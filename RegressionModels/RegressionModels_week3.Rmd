This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

library(datasets)
data(swiss)
require(stats)
require(graphics)

pairs(swiss, panel=panel.smooth, main = 'Swiss Data',
      col = 3 + (swiss$Catholic > 50)
      )

```

Let's try to find regression against each variable

```{r}
summary(lm(Fertility ~ ., data= swiss))

```
